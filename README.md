# üß™ Assignment 2: Types of Software Testing

This repository contains a summary of software testing types, created as part of a software development course.


## 1. Functional vs. Non-Functional Testing

| Aspect       | Functional Testing                    | Non-Functional Testing                     |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Definition   | Verifies *what* the system does        | Verifies *how* the system performs         |
| Purpose      | Ensure expected behavior               | Measure system qualities like performance  |
| Examples     | Login, search functionality            | Load test, stress test, security checks    |
| Test Basis   | Business requirements                  | System attributes                          |

## 2. Unit Testing vs. Integration Testing

| Aspect        | Unit Testing                             | Integration Testing                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Scope         | Tests individual modules or functions     | Tests interactions between components       |
| Performed By  | Developers                                | Developers or testers                       |
| Tools         | JUnit, PyTest, NUnit                      | Postman, Selenium, TestNG                   |

## 3. System Testing

- Tests the complete and integrated system.
- Ensures both functional and non-functional requirements are met.
- Example: Full user registration workflow from start to finish.

---

## 4. Acceptance Testing

- Conducted by end-users or clients.
- Two Types:
  - **Alpha Testing**: Done by internal users.
  - **Beta Testing**: Done by external testers.
- Purpose: Validate product meets expectations before release.

## 5. Types of Non-Functional Testing

| Type            | Purpose                                   | Example                           |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Performance     | System responsiveness                     | Response time under load          |
| Load            | System behavior under user load           | 1000 simultaneous users           |
| Stress          | Handling extreme conditions               | Spike in traffic                  |
| Usability       | User-friendliness                         | Easy navigation, readable fonts   |
| Security        | Identify vulnerabilities                  | SQL injection, password cracking  |
| Compatibility   | Work across platforms                     | Chrome, Firefox, Android, iOS     |
| Reliability     | Stable performance over time              | 24/7 system uptime                |
